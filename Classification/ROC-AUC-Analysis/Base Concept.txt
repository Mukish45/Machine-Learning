ROC stands for Receiver Operating Characteristic curve.
An ROC curve is a graph which is used to show the performance of a classification model at all classification thresholds. 
This curve plots two parameters:
  > True Positive Rate.
  > False Positive Rate.
  
True Positive Rate:
  True Positive Rate which is known as Recall. This is defined as follow:
    TPR = (TP)/(TP+FP).
      where TRP is the True Positive Rate,
      TP is the True Positive,
      FP is the False Positive.
      
False Positive Rate:
  False Positive Rate is defined as follow:
    FPR = (FP)/(FP+TN)
      where FPR is False Positive Rate,
      FP is the False Positive,
      TN is the True Negative.

Note:
> True positive are the samples which are actually true (1) and predicted also positive (1).
> True negative are the samples which are actually false (0) and predicted also false (0).
> False positive are the samples which are actually false (0) but predicted as true (1).
> False negative are the samples which are actually true (1) but predicted as false (0).

        Actual value | Prediction
* TP -  True (1)     | True (1)
* TN -  False(0)     | False(0)
* FP -  False(0)     | True (1)
* FN -  True (1)     | False(0)


An ROC curve plots TPR vs FPR at different classification thresholds. Lowering the classification threshold classifies more items as positive, thus increasing both False Positives and True Positives.

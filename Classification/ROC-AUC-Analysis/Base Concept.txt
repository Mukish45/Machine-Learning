ROC stands for Receiver Operating Characteristic curve.
An ROC curve is a graph which is used to show the performance of a classification model at all classification thresholds. 
This curve plots two parameters:
  > True Positive Rate.
  > False Positive Rate.
  
True Positive Rate:
  True Positive Rate which is known as Recall. This is defined as follow:
    TPR = (TP)/(TP+FP).
      where TRP is the True Positive Rate,
      TP is the True Positive,
      FP is the False Positive.
